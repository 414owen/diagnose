# Error reporting made easy

Diagnose is a small library used to report compiler/interpreter errors in a beautiful yet readable way.

As a great example, here's the output of the last test:

![first example](./assets/real-world-example-unicode.png)

If you do not like unicode characters, or choose to target platforms which cannot output them natively;
you may alternatively print the whole diagnostic with ASCII characters, like this:

![second example](./assets/real-world-example-ascii.png)
